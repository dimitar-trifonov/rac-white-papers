# 🧠 Requirements-as-Code (RaC) White Papers

This repository contains a growing collection of **practically grounded white papers** that define and explore the **Requirements-as-Code (RaC)** approach — a structured, declarative, and tech-agnostic method for improving software development in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 💡 What Is RaC?

**RaC** emerged from hands-on experience building AI-assisted software and discovering the limitations of pure prompt-based workflows. It introduces an **extra abstraction layer** that improves collaboration, traceability, and reliability when working with LLMs to create real-world applications.

Rather than being the result of a research grant or academic initiative, these white papers capture real developer insights — refined into a reusable framework.
