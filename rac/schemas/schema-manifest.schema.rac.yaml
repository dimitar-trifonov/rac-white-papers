# ðŸ’¡ NOTE: This schema structure is primarily optimized for frontend or full-stack applications.
# In domain-specific RaC implementations (e.g. policy engines, agent orchestration, backend-only APIs),
# folder names like `events/` may be replaced with `services/`, and `ui/` may become `api/` or be omitted entirely.
# The RaC framework is intentionally flexible â€” schemas are modular and may vary per use case.
