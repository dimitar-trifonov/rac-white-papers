# 📄 White Paper 1: RaC Foundation

## Title
**“Requirements-as-Code: A Foundation for Structured, AI-Native Software Development”**

## Abstract

This white paper defines the core philosophy, structure, and practical foundations of **Requirements-as-Code (RaC)** — a declarative, testable, and technology-agnostic approach that bridges human intent with AI-assisted software development. By shifting from ephemeral prompts to persistent structures, RaC introduces a durable layer of logic that enables simulation, collaboration, and seamless integration across the software development lifecycle (SDLC). RaC is not just a coding methodology — it is a **universal expression framework** for building systems that are understandable by both humans and machines.

## 1. Introduction

As generative AI reshapes the software landscape, one challenge remains persistent: **how to reliably transform human intent into working systems**. Prompt-based tools offer speed but lack structure. RaC offers a foundation — a new layer of abstraction that **encodes logic declaratively** and **preserves meaning over time**.

RaC reimagines software development as a conversation between structured requirements and executable systems. By modeling state, events, logic, UI, and tests as modular files, RaC enables shared understanding across roles and tools — and introduces a programmable interface between human ideas and machine execution.

---

## 2. Problem: Fragility of Prompt-Only Development

AI-powered tools today still rely primarily on freeform natural language. This causes:

- **Non-determinism** — outputs vary for the same prompt
- **Untraceability** — difficult to reproduce or audit behavior
- **Exclusion of stakeholders** — non-technical roles can't verify logic
- **Lack of simulation** — no structured way to preview app behavior
- **Code-first bias** — business logic is buried in implementation

---

## 3. RaC: A Structured Foundation

RaC solves these problems through five declarative components:

- `state/`: All system data, fields, and roles
- `events/`: What users or systems can do (frontend/backend, sync/async)
- `logic/`: Validation, security, business rules
- `ui/`: UI states and reactions to events
- `tests/`: Simulated flows that validate behavior

Optional folders:

- `bindings/`: Maps RaC to real tech stacks (React, Firebase, SQL, etc.)
- `docs/`: Embedded documentation for logic, access control, API mapping

RaC files are written in **clean, modular YAML**, allowing them to be read, simulated, extended, or reused — by humans *and* AI.

### 3.1 Extending to SaC (System-as-Code)

While RaC began as Requirements-as-Code—a single structured source of truth for features and business logic—the same declarative approach naturally extends to whole systems. We refer to this broader scope as System-as-Code (SaC): the expression of system behavior, policies, roles, and resources using the same structured, auditable primitives. In practice, RaC is the core; SaC is the superset when full-system specification is required.

---

## 4. Philosophical Foundation

RaC is based on a universal idea:

> “Meaning emerges from structured actions applied to a system, with remembered results logically related over time.”

This applies to systems of all kinds — from consciousness and governance to gameplay and scientific modeling. RaC formalizes this into **a language of systems**, built on the pillars of:

- **Structure** → Express intent declaratively
- **Action** → Define how intent is applied
- **Memory** → Persist results and relationships
- **Logic** → Validate causality and outcomes

## 5. Use Across the SDLC

| Phase          | Traditional AI Role         | RaC-Augmented Role                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Requirements   | Freeform notes or interviews| AI structured into `.rac.yaml` from dialogs |
| Design         | UI wireframes               | Simulated UI flows, layout hints            |
| Implementation | Prompt → Code               | RaC logic → Code generation via bindings    |
| Testing        | Snippet suggestions         | Structured RaC tests → Executable test sets |
| Maintenance    | Manual edits                | Granular RaC updates, partial regeneration  |

This turns RaC into a **persistent interface between AI and the development process**.

## 6. Core Benefits

- ✅ **Traceability** — Know where logic lives, simulate its flow  
- ✅ **Cross-role collaboration** — Designers, PMs, QA can all read/write logic  
- ✅ **AI-native structure** — Ideal input/output format for LLMs  
- ✅ **Framework-agnostic** — Bind once, reuse logic across stacks  
- ✅ **Simulation-first** — Preview behavior before implementation  
- ✅ **Versionable and auditable** — No more lost prompts or hidden business rules  

---

## 7. From Foundation to Platform

RaC begins with software — but extends beyond:

### 📦 Phase 1: App Development (Today)
- SDLC modeling (`state/`, `events/`, `logic/`, etc.)
- Tech bindings (React, Firebase, SQL, Genkit)
- Tooling integration (Bolt.new, Cursor, Windsurf)

### 🔄 Phase 2: Business, Governance, AI Systems
- Model processes, policies, agent flows, game narratives
- Share RaC packs per domain (e.g., HR, policy, health)

### 🤖 Phase 3: Self-Evolving RaC
- Reflexive systems that adjust their own logic
- Agent-assisted RaC builders and validators
- RaC-as-a-Service platforms and visual composers

## 8. Related Work and Innovations

The core idea behind Requirements-as-Code (RaC) — that structured requirements should be executable — is not entirely new. Earlier efforts such as:

- 📄 **David Sprogis** explored how AI augments software development with structured requirements and rule-based logic [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/requirements-code-how-ai-changing-software-david-sprogis-4rnue/)
- 🧩 **Bertil Muth’s Requirements as Code** introduced an imperative-style Java library for connecting events to actions [Medium](https://bertilmuth.medium.com/requirements-as-code-v1-0-0-published-ba3365b5fd71)

However, these approaches often remain tied to specific technologies or imperative codebases, lacking:

- ✅ A declarative, **tech-agnostic format**  
- ✅ Full **YAML-based modularity**  
- ✅ Tight **AI integration and simulation** support  
- ✅ Cross-role collaboration (PMs, QA, designers)  
- ✅ Use in **multi-phase SDLC**, not just implementation

RaC builds on these roots but introduces a **practical, tool-ready, and AI-native** framework designed for modern generative workflows — bridging the gap between **human intention and software systems** with more clarity, auditability, and composability than ever before.

## 9. Conclusion

RaC is not a tool. It’s **a foundation** — for how we design systems, simulate their behavior, and build them collaboratively with AI. It reclaims structure in a world of fleeting prompts and ephemeral prototypes. And it opens the door to a future where AI is not just a generator — but a **true collaborator in logic-driven system design**.

## 10. Glossary

- **Requirements-as-Code (RaC)**: Declarative specification of application requirements using modular YAML across `state/`, `events/`, `logic/`, `ui/`, and `tests/` to define behavior, validation, and expected outcomes.
- **System-as-Code (SaC)**: Generalization of RaC to full-system scope, covering policies, roles, resources, integrations, and operational rules while retaining the same structured, auditable primitives.

## Appendix A: Development (RaC Core)

```bash
app/
├── state/        # domain entities, fields, and role definitions
├── events/       # user/system actions (sync/async)
├── logic/        # validation, authorization, business rules
├── ui/           # view states and reactions (or api/ for service interfaces)
├── tests/        # simulated flows and assertions
├── bindings/     # technology mappings (React, SQL, Firebase, etc.)
├── schemas/      # validation schemas and manifest (e.g., *.schema.rac.yaml)
├── data/         # static dictionaries, config, constants
├── docs/         # narrative documentation (optional)
└── README.md
```

Focus: day-to-day development using the RaC core. `schemas/` enables consistent validation across all `.rac.yaml` files; `bindings/` map declarative logic to concrete stacks. This minimal structure also suits task-focused use cases (e.g., editor rules like `.windsurfrules`, automation snippets, or small utilities).

## Appendix B: System Design (SaC Scope)

```bash
app/
├── policies/     # authZ, retention, SLAs, rate limits (optional)
├── resources/    # external/internal systems & capabilities (optional)
├── roles/        # if not modeled within state/ (optional)
├── integrations/ # provider mappings beyond codegen (optional)
└── compliance/   # audit, evidence, controls (optional)
```

Use when modeling full systems: cross-cutting policies, roles, resources/integrations, and compliance. These folders extend RaC into SaC without changing the core primitives.
